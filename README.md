# README

The ruby version required for rails `6.1.x` is `>= 2.5.0`. I used ruby 3.0. 

From the root of your app, run `bundle` to install required gems and dependent gems.

To start your web server, from the root of your app run: `rails s`

*Note* This app assumes your databases exists outside of the application.  In other words it does not exist in the default <your_app>/db/ directory.  Instead the database exists at: ../imported_dbs/musings_database.sqlite3

The reasoning for doing this is so that I can seperately version a repo containing all the sqlite databases for each of my personal apps.
